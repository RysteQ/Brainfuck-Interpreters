# Brainfuck Interpreters

This repository contains brainfuck interpreters for the following languages

- Assembly
- C
- Rust
- C#
- Python

All of the brainfuck interpreters have 30000 bytes of memory (as listed on the wikipedia page for brainfuck) and as of the x86 interpreter it will only run under a linux machine and not on a windows machine.

Also, if there are any bugs on my code (which is **very** likely) just do a pr because I do not test my code as much as other people do
